Implementing Caching

Course: Backend Developer Course

Assignment Deadline: [Insert Deadline]

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience in implementing caching in a web application. The objective is to choose a web application scenario (e.g., an e-commerce site) and identify specific data or content that can benefit from caching. You will then implement caching for the selected data or content within your chosen back-end framework. Code examples and explanations are required to demonstrate your understanding.

Instructions:
Please complete the following tasks to implement caching in a web application:

Task 1: Web Application Scenario Selection (10 points)
Choose a web application scenario for which you will implement caching. Examples include e-commerce sites, news websites, or social media platforms. Identify specific data or content within the chosen scenario that can benefit from caching.

Task 2: Caching Implementation (60 points)
Implement caching for the selected data or content within your chosen back-end framework. Be sure to provide code examples and explanations for each step of the implementation process. Your implementation should include:

Configuration of caching settings in your back-end framework.
Code snippets demonstrating how data/content is cached and retrieved.
Any relevant caching policies or rules.
Task 3: Presentation (10 points)
Organize your caching implementation code and explanations into a clear and well-structured document. Ensure that your assignment is free of grammatical and spelling errors.

Task 4: Testing and Validation (20 points)
Test your caching implementation to ensure that it functions as intended. Provide evidence of testing and validation, including any test cases or scenarios used and their outcomes.

Submission Guidelines:

Compile your caching implementation code, explanations, and testing details into a document (PDF or Word).
Include any relevant references or sources you consulted during your implementation.
Submit your assignment as a document.
Grading Rubric:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Quality and completeness of caching implementation (60 points)
Clarity and effectiveness of code examples and explanations (20 points)
Organization and presentation of the assignment (10 points)
Testing and validation of the caching implementation (20 points)
Adherence to submission guidelines (10 points)
