Assignment Deadline: [Insert Deadline]

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will explore the fundamentals of scalability in web applications. The objective is to define scalability and explain its importance for modern web applications. You will also discuss at least three techniques for achieving scalability, such as load balancing, horizontal scaling, and auto-scaling, providing real-world examples of each technique.

Instructions:
Please complete the following tasks to explore scalability concepts:

Task 1: What is Scalability? (30 points)
Define scalability in the context of web applications and software systems. Explain why scalability is essential for modern web applications and how it impacts user experience and system reliability.
