RESTful API Implementation

Course: Backend Developer Course

Assignment Deadline: [Insert Deadline]

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will implement a RESTful API based on the design created in Homework Assignment 1. The objective is to develop the RESTful API for the chosen project scenario using your back-end framework of choice (e.g., Express.js, Flask, Ruby on Rails). Your implementation should include routes, controllers, and necessary database interactions, ensuring that the API adheres to the REST architectural principles.

Instructions:
Please complete the following tasks to implement the RESTful API:

Task 1: Project Scenario and Design (10 points)
Refer to the project scenario and API design created in Homework Assignment 1. Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the API endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication mechanisms, and usage examples.

Task 2: API Implementation (60 points)
Implement the RESTful API in your chosen back-end framework, considering the following aspects:

Routes: Define the routes and endpoints for each resource and operation based on your API design.
Controllers: Create controllers to handle incoming requests, validate data, and interact with the database.
Database interactions: Implement the necessary database operations (e.g., CRUD operations) to manage the resources.
Request validation: Ensure that incoming requests are properly validated and sanitized.
Authentication: Implement the authentication mechanisms as defined in your API design.
Error handling: Implement error handling and response formatting according to RESTful principles.
Task 3: API Testing (20 points)
Test your API to ensure that it functions as intended. Create test cases and scenarios to cover various endpoints and operations. Document the testing process and any issues encountered.

Task 4: Documentation Updates (10 points)
Update your API documentation to reflect any changes or additions made during the implementation. Ensure that the documentation is accurate and up to date.

Task 5: Presentation (10 points)
Organize your API implementation, testing details, and documentation updates into a clear and well-structured document. Ensure that your assignment is free of grammatical and spelling errors.

Submission Guidelines:

Compile your API implementation, testing details, and documentation updates into a document (PDF or Word).
Include any relevant references or sources you consulted during your implementation.
Submit your assignment as a document.
Grading Rubric:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Quality and completeness of API implementation (60 points)
Quality and completeness of API testing (20 points)
Accuracy and completeness of documentation updates (10 points)
Organization and presentation of the assignment (10 points)
Adherence to submission guidelines (10 points)
