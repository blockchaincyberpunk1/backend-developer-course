Server-Side Rendering Application (SSR)

Course: Backend Developer Course

Assignment Deadline: [Insert Deadline]

Assignment Overview:
In this optional assignment, you will have the opportunity to extend your skills by developing a web application using server-side rendering (SSR). The objective is to choose a front-end framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) and develop a simple web application. You will implement server-side rendering using a framework or library appropriate for your chosen back-end technology (e.g., Next.js for Node.js).

Instructions:
Please complete the following tasks to develop a Server-Side Rendering (SSR) web application:

Task 1: Front-End Framework and Application Design (20 points)
Choose a front-end framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) and design a simple web application. Outline the key features and functionality that your application will offer.

Task 2: Back-End Framework or Library Selection (20 points)
Select a back-end framework or library that supports server-side rendering (SSR). Examples include Next.js for Node.js or Nuxt.js for Vue.js. Explain why you chose this framework or library for your project.

Task 3: Application Implementation (40 points)
Develop your web application using the chosen front-end framework and back-end SSR technology. Ensure that your application includes server-side rendering for at least one page or component. Implement any necessary routing, data fetching, and rendering logic.

Task 4: Testing and Validation (10 points)
Test your SSR web application to ensure that it functions as intended. Document any issues encountered during testing and any solutions you implemented.

Task 5: Presentation (10 points)
Organize your assignment into a clear and well-structured document. Include explanations, code snippets, and any relevant references or sources. Ensure that your assignment is free of grammatical and spelling errors.
