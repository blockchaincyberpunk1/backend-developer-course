API Testing and Validation

Course: Backend Developer Course

Assignment Deadline: [Insert Deadline]

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will focus on testing and validating your RESTful API. The objective is to develop a comprehensive suite of test cases to evaluate the functionality and correctness of your API endpoints. You should include tests for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Additionally, you will use testing tools (e.g., Postman, Insomnia) or testing libraries (e.g., Jest, Mocha) to execute your test cases and validate the API's behavior.

Instructions:
Please complete the following tasks to test and validate your RESTful API:

Task 1: Test Case Development (40 points)
Develop a suite of test cases that thoroughly evaluate the functionality and correctness of your API endpoints. Ensure that your test cases cover various scenarios, including but not limited to:

Valid input data for creating or updating resources.
Invalid input data that should trigger error responses.
Testing different HTTP methods for each endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Authentication and authorization scenarios if applicable.
Task 2: Testing Environment Setup (20 points)
Choose a testing tool or testing library that you will use to execute your test cases. Examples include Postman, Insomnia, Jest, Mocha, or any other suitable tool or library. Set up your testing environment and ensure that it is ready to execute your test suite.

Task 3: Test Execution (20 points)
Execute your suite of test cases against your RESTful API. Record the outcomes of each test case, including whether it passed or failed, and any relevant details or responses received from the API.

Task 4: Validation and Reporting (10 points)
Validate the results of your tests and confirm that your API behaves as expected. If any test cases fail, investigate and document the issues encountered. Create a summary report of your test results.

Task 5: Presentation (10 points)
Organize your test cases, testing environment setup details, test execution results, validation findings, and the summary report into a clear and well-structured document. Ensure that your assignment is free of grammatical and spelling errors.

Submission Guidelines:

Compile your test cases, testing environment setup details, test execution results, validation findings, and summary report into a document (PDF or Word).
Include any relevant references or sources you consulted during your testing.
Submit your assignment as a document.
Grading Rubric:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Quality and completeness of test case development (40 points)
Quality and completeness of testing environment setup (20 points)
Accuracy and thoroughness of test execution and validation (20 points)
Organization and presentation of the assignment (10 points)
Adherence to submission guidelines (10 points)
