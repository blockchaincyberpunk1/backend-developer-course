API Design and Documentation

Course: Backend Developer Course

Assignment Deadline: [Insert Deadline]

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will design and document RESTful APIs for a hypothetical project. The objective is to choose a project scenario (e.g., a task management application) and outline the key resources and operations that your API will support. You will create a detailed API design document that includes API endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication mechanisms, and usage examples.

Instructions:
Please complete the following tasks to design and document your RESTful APIs:

Task 1: Project Scenario Selection (10 points)
Choose a hypothetical project scenario for which you will design and document RESTful APIs. Examples include task management applications, e-commerce platforms, or social media networks. Identify the key resources and operations that your API will need to support within this scenario.

Task 2: API Design (40 points)
Outline the design of your RESTful APIs, considering the following aspects:

API endpoints: Define the specific endpoints for each resource and operation. Use resource-based URLs (e.g., /tasks, /users) and appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Request and response schemas: Describe the structure and format of request and response data, including any required headers or parameters.
Authentication mechanisms: Specify how authentication will be handled in your API (e.g., token-based authentication, OAuth, API keys).
Error handling: Explain how errors and exceptions will be communicated to clients.
Security considerations: Discuss any security measures or practices implemented in your API design.
Task 3: API Documentation (40 points)
Create a detailed API design document that includes the following sections:

Introduction: Provide an overview of the project and its goals.
Resource descriptions: Describe each resource in your API, including its attributes, relationships, and usage.
Endpoint documentation: Document each API endpoint, including its URL, HTTP method, request format, and response format. Include example requests and responses.
Authentication instructions: Explain how clients should authenticate with your API, including any token generation or authentication flow.
Usage examples: Provide practical usage examples of your API, showcasing how clients can interact with it to achieve common tasks.
Task 4: Presentation (10 points)
Organize your API design and documentation into a clear and well-structured document. Ensure that your assignment is free of grammatical and spelling errors.

Submission Guidelines:

Compile your API design and documentation into a document (PDF or Word).
Include any relevant references or sources you consulted during your design.
Submit your assignment as a document.
Grading Rubric:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Quality and completeness of API design (40 points)
Quality and completeness of API documentation (40 points)
Organization and presentation of the assignment (10 points)
Adherence to submission guidelines (10 points)
