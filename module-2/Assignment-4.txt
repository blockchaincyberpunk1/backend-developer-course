API Implementation

Course: Backend Developer Course

Assignment Deadline: [Insert Deadline]

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will put your knowledge of RESTful API design principles into practice. The objective is to build a simple RESTful API using your chosen server-side programming language (e.g., Python, Ruby, Node.js, Java, PHP). You will design and implement a basic RESTful API for a hypothetical web application (e.g., a to-do list manager). Additionally, you will document the API endpoints, describe their purpose, and provide sample request and response data to demonstrate your implementation.

Instructions:
Please complete the following tasks to design and implement your RESTful API:

Task 1: API Design (20 points)
Design a basic RESTful API for a hypothetical web application. The application can be a simple to-do list manager. Your API should include the following endpoints:

Retrieve a list of items.
Retrieve a specific item by ID.
Create a new item.
Update an existing item.
Delete an item.
For each endpoint, provide:

The HTTP method to be used (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
The resource-based URL (e.g., /items, /items/{id}).
A brief description of the endpoint's purpose.
Any required request parameters or request body (if applicable).
Task 2: API Implementation (40 points)
Implement your designed RESTful API using your chosen server-side programming language. You can use a web framework if applicable.

Create the necessary routes, controllers, and logic to handle each endpoint.
Ensure that the API can handle common operations, including retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting items.
Implement basic error handling for invalid requests or missing resources.
Test your API locally to verify that it functions as expected.
Task 3: Documentation (20 points)
Document your RESTful API, including its endpoints, purpose, and sample request and response data for each endpoint. Your documentation should include:

A clear list of all API endpoints with their descriptions.
Sample request payloads or query parameters (if applicable).
Sample response data, including status codes and JSON responses.
Any additional information or notes that are relevant to understanding and using the API.
Task 4: Presentation (10 points)
Organize your findings, code snippets, and documentation into a clear and well-structured document. Ensure that your assignment is free of grammatical and spelling errors.

Submission Guidelines:

Compile your code and documentation into a document (PDF or Word).
Include any relevant references or sources you consulted during your implementation.
Submit your assignment as a document along with any necessary supplementary files (e.g., code files).
Grading Rubric:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Quality and completeness of API design (20 points)
Accuracy and functionality of API implementation (40 points)
Clarity and completeness of API documentation (20 points)
Organization and presentation of the assignment (10 points)
Adherence to submission guidelines (5 points)
Overall presentation and professionalism (5 points)
