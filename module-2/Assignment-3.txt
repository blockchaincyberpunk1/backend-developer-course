Course: Backend Developer Course

Assignment Deadline: [Insert Deadline]

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will dive into the world of RESTful API design. The objective is to learn how to design RESTful APIs for web applications. You will define what a RESTful API is and explain its core principles, including statelessness, resource-based URLs, and the use of HTTP methods. To reinforce your understanding, you will provide an example scenario (e.g., a simple blog application) and outline the endpoints and operations that would be part of its RESTful API.

Instructions:
Please complete the following tasks to explore RESTful API design principles:

Task 1: RESTful API Definition and Principles (20 points)
Define what a RESTful API is and explain its core principles:

Provide a concise definition of a RESTful API.
Explain the statelessness principle in the context of REST.
Describe the concept of resource-based URLs and how they are used in RESTful APIs.
Discuss the significance of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) in RESTful API design.
Task 2: RESTful API Example (35 points)
Imagine a simple blog application and outline the endpoints and operations that would be part of its RESTful API. Your API should include the following operations:

Retrieve a list of blog posts.
Retrieve a specific blog post by ID.
Create a new blog post.
Update an existing blog post.
Delete a blog post.
For each operation, provide:

The HTTP method to be used (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
The resource-based URL (e.g., /posts, /posts/{id}).
A brief description of the operation's purpose.
Any required request parameters or request body (if applicable).
Task 3: Presentation (10 points)
Organize your findings into a clear and well-structured document. Ensure that your assignment is free of grammatical and spelling errors.

Submission Guidelines:

Compile your research and explanations into a document (PDF or Word).
Include any relevant references or sources you consulted during your research.
Submit your assignment as a document along with any necessary supplementary files.
Grading Rubric:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Clarity and completeness of RESTful API principles (20 points)
Accuracy and depth of RESTful API example (35 points)
Organization and presentation of the assignment (10 points)
Adherence to submission guidelines (10 points)
Overall presentation and professionalism (25 points)
