NoSQL Database Exploration (Optional)

Course: Backend Developer Course

Assignment Deadline: [Insert Deadline]

Assignment Overview (Optional):
In this optional assignment, you will gain hands-on experience with a NoSQL database. The objective is to choose one of the NoSQL databases studied in the course, such as MongoDB or Cassandra, and set up a database instance. You will then create a simple data model relevant to a hypothetical project, such as a document store for a content management system. Finally, you will provide examples of data insertion and retrieval to demonstrate your understanding.

Instructions:
Please complete the following tasks if you choose to explore a NoSQL database as an optional assignment:

Task 1: Database Selection (10 points)
Choose one of the NoSQL databases studied in the course (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) that you will use for this assignment.

Task 2: Database Setup (20 points)
Set up a database instance of the selected NoSQL database on your local machine or using a cloud-based service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, Amazon DynamoDB). Ensure that the database is ready for data modeling and interaction.

Task 3: Data Modeling (40 points)
Create a simple data model for a hypothetical project. For example, you could design a document store for a content management system (CMS) where each document represents an article. Define the structure of your documents, including key fields and their data types.

Task 4: Data Insertion and Retrieval (20 points)
Provide examples of data insertion and retrieval using the NoSQL database you set up. Insert a few sample documents into the database and demonstrate how to query and retrieve this data. Include code snippets and explanations to illustrate your process.

Task 5: Presentation (10 points)
Organize your database setup, data model, data insertion, and retrieval examples into a clear and well-structured document. Ensure that your assignment is free of grammatical and spelling errors.

Submission Guidelines:

Compile your setup, data model, and examples into a document (PDF or Word).
Include any relevant references or sources you consulted during your exploration.
Submit your assignment as a document.
Grading Rubric:
If you choose to complete this optional assignment, it will be graded based on the following criteria:

Quality and completeness of database setup (20 points)
Clarity and relevance of data model (40 points)
Quality and effectiveness of data insertion and retrieval examples (20 points)
Organization and presentation of the assignment (10 points)
Adherence to submission guidelines (10 points)
