Containerization with Docker

Course: Backend Developer Course

Assignment Deadline: [Insert Deadline]

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will focus on exploring containerization using Docker. The objective is to define containerization and its benefits in deploying and managing applications. You will create a Dockerfile for a simple web application (e.g., a static website) and build a Docker image. Additionally, you will document the steps and commands used in the Dockerfile.

Instructions:
Please complete the following tasks to learn and practice containerization with Docker:

Task 1: Containerization Introduction (20 points)
Write a brief explanation of what containerization is and why it's essential in deploying and managing applications. Discuss the benefits of containerization, such as isolation, portability, and resource efficiency.

Task 2: Project Selection and Dockerfile Creation (40 points)
Choose a simple web application scenario (e.g., a static website, a simple API server) that you will use for this assignment. Create a Dockerfile for your chosen web application. Include the following elements in your Dockerfile:

Base image selection: Choose an appropriate base image (e.g., a Linux distribution) for your application.
Installation of dependencies: Install any necessary dependencies or packages required for your application to run.
Copying files: Copy the files needed for your web application into the Docker image.
Configuration: If applicable, set environment variables or configuration options.
Command execution: Specify the command that should be executed when the container starts (e.g., starting a web server).
Task 3: Docker Image Building (20 points)
Build a Docker image using the Dockerfile you created in Task 2. Use the docker build command to create the image. Document the steps and commands used in the Dockerfile for building the image.

Task 4: Presentation (10 points)
Organize your assignment into a clear and well-structured document. Include explanations, the Dockerfile content, commands used for image building, and any relevant references or sources. Ensure that your assignment is free of grammatical and spelling errors.

Submission Guidelines:

Compile your assignment into a document (PDF or Word).
Include any relevant references or sources you consulted during your research.
If possible, share the Docker image on a container registry or hosting platform (e.g., Docker Hub) and provide the image's repository link.
Grading Rubric:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Quality and completeness of the containerization introduction (20 points)
Proper creation of the Dockerfile (40 points)
Successful building of the Docker image (20 points)
Organization and presentation of the assignment (10 points)
Adherence to submission guidelines (10 points)
