Cloud Deployment

Course: Backend Developer Course

Assignment Deadline: [Insert Deadline]

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will focus on exploring cloud-based deployment options for back-end applications. The objective is to research and select a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) suitable for deploying your application. You will then deploy your back-end application to the chosen cloud platform, taking into consideration scalability and reliability factors. Additionally, you will provide documentation on the cloud deployment process.

Instructions:
Please complete the following tasks to learn and practice cloud-based deployment for back-end applications:

Task 1: Cloud Platform Selection (20 points)
Research and select a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) that is suitable for deploying your back-end application. Explain why you chose this particular cloud platform and mention any specific services or features that influenced your decision.

Task 2: Cloud Deployment Preparation (40 points)
Prepare your back-end application for cloud deployment. This may involve tasks such as:

Containerization: If not already done, create a Docker image for your application.
Database setup: Set up the necessary database services on the chosen cloud platform.
Configuration: Prepare configuration files or environment variables required for deployment.
Task 3: Cloud Deployment Process (20 points)
Deploy your back-end application to the selected cloud platform. Document the deployment process step by step, including any cloud-specific tools or commands you used. Ensure that your deployment considers factors such as scalability and reliability.

Task 4: Testing and Verification (10 points)
Test your application to ensure it is functioning correctly in the cloud environment. Document the testing process and any issues encountered during testing.

Task 5: Documentation (10 points)
Organize your assignment into a clear and well-structured document. Include explanations, the cloud platform used, deployment steps, testing results, and any relevant references or sources. Ensure that your assignment is free of grammatical and spelling errors.

Submission Guidelines:

Compile your assignment into a document (PDF or Word).
Include any relevant references or sources you consulted during your research.
If applicable, provide access or permissions to view your deployed application on the cloud platform.
Grading Rubric:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Quality and appropriateness of the cloud platform selection (20 points)
Proper preparation for cloud deployment (40 points)
Successful cloud deployment process (20 points)
Testing and verification of the cloud-deployed application (10 points)
Organization and presentation of the assignment (10 points)
